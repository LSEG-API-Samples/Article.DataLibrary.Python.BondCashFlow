# Payout Schedule & Cash Flow Analysis for a Bond Portfolio

When holding a portfolio of bonds, it's of particular importance to manage the expected payback (be it Interest Payments or Principal) to be received in the next months, 
quarters and even years. This allows one to anticipate the expected cash flows from the coupons and the receipt of principal payments on bonds that are nearing maturity date, 
and to look at total amounts in the desired currency. Thanks to the LSEG Data Library for Python and the Instrument Pricing Analytics (IPA) APIs, this is made simple.

Follow the steps below to get more insight into your Bond Portfolio.

Refer to the [Bond CashFlow Article](https://developers.lseg.com/en/article-catalog/article/payout-schedule-and-cash-flow-analysis-for-a-bond-portfolio) defined within the
